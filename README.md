# **Hello World! - Data Science Bootcamp**
This repository was created with simple program that prints the classic "Hello World!" message and than any other messagesm like "Git is Awesome!". 
Also this repository was created to educate related to the basic *workflow of using Git and GitHub* for version control and collaboration.

It serves as a starting point for your Data Science Bootcamp journey!

**The workflow of using Git and GitHub included:**

1. Create a GitHub Repository
2. Set up Local Environment
3. Create and Track Code File
4. Modify and Commit
5. Connect to Remote Repository
6. Push to GitHub
7. Create a README File
8. Push README File

**What's Included:**

A single file with code declaring a variable to hold any message, in this case, "Git is Awesome!" and then uses the print() function to display that message on the console.

This is a very basic example, but it demonstrates fundamental concepts like:

*Variables: Storing data in memory using a name.*
*String literals: Representing text data within a program.*
*Assignment: Assigning values to variables.*
*Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.*

*Code:*

message = "Git is Awesome!"

print(message)
